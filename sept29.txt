Assignment #4: YACC/Bison (10/11)
	* Expression grammar
	* +, -, *, /, %: binary operations
	* @: unary operator to double a value
	* about: unary, means "term is about this number"
	* id, num, ZERO, TWO, TEN
	* ( )

Assume a case-insensitive language.

5 * TEN = 50
	
Does the string belong in our language?  This is the only output he needs.  "Yes" or "no".

YACC does not build ids or numbers.  That's for scanners.  Parser is the most important part.
It drives the compiler.  This is the part that holds it all together.

Individual.

Build this up in small steps.
